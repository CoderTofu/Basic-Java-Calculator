# CALCULATOR APP

This is a calculator app I made after watching a couple hours worth of tutorials in java.

## How do I run this on my machine?
I have not yet created an executable jar file for this project as it still not yet finished.

However, if you wish to run this on your machine simply pull this repo to a designated folder and run the Main file.

No libraries or frameworks was used in this project.

I recommend you have at least OpenJDK ver 11. As I am not sure if the project will run properly if you are using an outdated jdk.
