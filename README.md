# CALCULATOR APP

This is a calculator app I made after watching a couple hours worth of tutorials in java.

## How do I run this on my machine?
Just run the main java file and everything should work properly.

No libraries or frameworks was used in this project.

I recommend you have at least OpenJDK ver 11. As I am not sure if the project will run properly if you are using an outdated jdk.
